# Here you can define all your data sets by using simple YAML syntax.
#
# Documentation for this file format can be found in "The Data Catalog"
# Link: https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data/data_catalog.html
#
# We support interacting with a variety of data stores including local file systems, cloud, network and HDFS
#
# The Data Catalog supports being able to reference the same file using two different DataSet implementations
# (transcoding), templating and a way to reuse arguments that are frequently repeated. See more here:
